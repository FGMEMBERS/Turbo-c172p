$FG_ROOT/Aircraft/c172p/Models/Liveries/D-ECJB.xml

Livery works for the c172p at the state of FG 2.10.x. I am not able to
recall when this model was introduced. But it works, at least, since
version 2.4.

This livery is a replica of the one that Mathias Rust's[1] Cessna has
had the day he landed next to the Red Square, Moscow. The Cessna now is
displayed at Deutsches Technikmuseum Berlin, Germany[2].
As reference for creation served pictures from Wikimedia[3][4][5].

Problems: Because of the angle of reference images the livery is more or
less a guesswork and not very accurate. Major drawback is the white
spinner. The livery's author is not a 3d modeler and therefore has had to
stick to the paintkit which does not support repainting it; same for the
propeller. On the lower side of the windshield there are known problems
with the mapping[6]. Also, the 3d model does not seem to be very accurate
regarding dimensions and shape of some details. The wingtips are strong
indicators for this, compare [3] with FG's 3d model.
